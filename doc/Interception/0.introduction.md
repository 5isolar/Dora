**Dora.Interception** provides an extensible interception model for AOP programming. Leveraging such an interception model, we can define and register Interceptor to conduct non-business cross-cutting function in a very elegantly programming style. **Dora.Interception** is particularly designed for .NET Core, and the **Dependency Injection** (Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection) is inherently integrated. **Dora.Interception** provides a built-in interception mechanism named Dynamic Proxy, which is based on IL Emit. We can also provide our custom interception implementation if we want.
